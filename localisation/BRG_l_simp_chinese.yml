#新闻
brgnews.1.t: "斯沃洛斯科岛主权争端白热化"
brgnews.1.desc: "自由合众国第三舰队于今日凌晨对斯沃洛斯科岛南部实施两栖登陆，麦克阿瑟上将宣布“恢复博林克尼亚共和国合法主权”。\n该岛屿自一战期间被自由合众国从大洋联邦夺取后，长期以“非强制保护国”名义实施军事管制。一周前，岛上97.6%居民投票赞成回归大洋联邦，但自由合众国宣称公投存在“外部势力操控”。"
brgnews.1.a: "\"和平靠边站了。\""

brgnews.2.t: "斯沃洛斯科岛爆发武装冲突"
brgnews.2.desc: "在21天的军事对峙后，自由合众国第三舰队与海军陆战队于今日拂晓向斯沃洛斯科岛北部发起全面进攻。\n麦克阿瑟上将发表声明，称此次行动旨在“清除大洋联邦非法渗透势力，恢复博林克尼亚共和国宪政秩序”。"
brgnews.2.a: "\"算总账的日子终将到来。\""

brgnews.3.t: "麦克阿瑟黯然离场"
brgnews.3.desc: "自由合众国第三舰队司令麦克阿瑟上将今日宣布“基于战略重组需求”，正式撤离斯沃洛斯科岛全部军事力量。\n值得注意的是，其麾下特遣舰队将原属博林克尼亚共和国的南部海军编队整建制撤回本土，仅留下空荡的斯拉卡码头与17座未拆除的监听天线阵列。\n\n本报注：博林克尼亚议会大厦降下国旗时，扩音器误播放自由合众国海军军乐《起锚进行曲》，持续23秒后被切断。"
brgnews.3.a: "\"麦跑跑，对吗？\""

brgnews.4.t: "大洋联邦签署《黑礁协定》"
brgnews.4.desc: "在自由合众国第三舰队完成对斯沃洛斯科岛72小时封锁后，大洋联邦议会今日宣布接受《黑礁协定》，将撤出全部驻岛部队及战略设施。\n引人注目的是，其部署在北部山区的“彼岸花-7”临时雷达站被爆破拆除前，操作员向自由合众国发送明码电报："
brgnews.4.a: "\"建议贵军在坐标N12°34'安装旋转木马——此处风景绝佳。\""

brgnews.5.t: "自由合众国迫于全球声浪撤离斯沃洛斯科岛"
brgnews.5.desc: "自由合众国今日宣布结束对斯沃洛斯科岛的军事存在，麦克阿瑟将军亲自签署《蓝海撤军令》，将博林克尼亚共和国南部海军舰队全数撤回本土。\n此举被视为对国际社会长达三周密集施压的妥协。\n\n\n本报注：自由合众国撤离舰队离港时，博林克尼亚海岸警卫队雷达突现密集光点，后证实为麦克阿瑟下令抛撒的3吨铝箔干扰片，拼出“GOODBYE AND GOOD LUCK”字样。"
brgnews.5.a: "\"似曾相识的场面……\""

brgnews.6.t: "“黑峡协定”协议签署 南北分治格局成型"
brgnews.6.desc: "在长达63天的激烈拉锯战后，自由合众国与大洋联邦今日于圣胡安市签署《黑峡协定》，宣布斯沃洛斯科岛实施“非对称分治”：包括首都在内的北部领土归属大洋联邦，南部深水港及3处军事基地由自由合众国第三舰队“临时监管”。\n耐人寻味的是，协议墨迹未干，大洋联邦众议院即以329票反对、259票支持、12票弃权支持否决该条约，称其“纵容军事强权肢解法理领土”。\n本报注：大洋联邦参议院议长办公室今日流出一份备忘录，标题为《如何优雅地输掉一场胜利——分治协议谈判技巧十讲》，扉页批注显示："
